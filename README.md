# Programmer Calculator

When it's done, the calculator will allow users to perform the following operations:
*  Bit manipulations (or, xor, ~, and)
*  Mathematical operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, remainder)
*  Expressions (grouping, etc.)

Supported bases are
*  Decimal (base 10)
*  Hexidecimal (base 16)
*  Binary (base 2)
*  Octal (base 8)

I'm just learning Python. If there are ways things can be done better, I'd love to know.

To do:
*  Expression parser
*  Interface. At first will be command line, but will add GUI to help me learn how to make a GUI in Python.
